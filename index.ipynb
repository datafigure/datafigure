        "The format and level is flexible - past events have ranged from short intros to multi-day advanced seminars. Besides standalone events, venues have included summer schools, academic retreats, invited lectures, and international conferences and hackathons, so far in 5 countries across Europe.\n",

        "Mostly been beginner-level practical workshops, often aimed at people with advanced skills in their discipline (such as humanities or social science), but little to no programming skills. A typical 1-day workshop consist of an introduction to R and basic exercises, followed by data visualization and/or wrangling exercises. Why start with dataviz? Because (1) it is an integral component of doing science anyway, and (2) it's more fun to learn programming when you can immedately see and interpret the results of your first coding attempts (and making nice plots in R is very easy and intuitive, especially with packages like ggplot2 and plotly).\n",

        "\n",
        "These digital skills seminar events have focused on generative AI like ChatGPT, and how these technological advances may affect education, learning and teaching now and in the near future. Overview lecture in the first half, group discussions and brainstorming in the second half.\n",

Past workshops have also been funded by combinations of similar programmes and university travel grants, if the event involves research activities for the organizer.
