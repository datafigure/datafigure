    "text": "We organize workshops on programming in R, data visualization, data wrangling, corpus linguistics, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence (including recent workshops on the impact of ChatGPT and generative AI on the education sector). The format and level is flexible - past events have ranged from short intros to multi-day advanced seminars. Besides standalone events, venues have included summer schools, academic retreats, invited lectures, and international conferences and hackathons, so far in 5 countries across Europe.\nBelow is a list of the types of workshops organized in the past. However, all the training events we do are customized and adapted to the audience, so the same exact event is seldom repeated twice."

    "text": "R programming, data wrangling, data visualization\nMostly been beginner-level practical workshops, often aimed at people with advanced skills in their discipline (such as humanities or social science), but little to no programming skills. A typical 1-day workshop consist of an introduction to R and basic exercises, followed by data visualization and/or wrangling exercises. Why start with dataviz? Because (1) it is an integral component of doing science anyway, and (2) it’s more fun to learn programming when you can immedately see and interpret the results of your first coding attempts (and making nice plots in R is very easy and intuitive, especially with packages like ggplot2 and plotly)."
