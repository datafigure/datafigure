    "text": "Custom Workshops\nIf our interests overlap, then I’d be happy to tailor a course, workshop or hackathon to suit the learning needs, data and interests of you or your colleagues or students. There are a few different options to cover expenses related to the preparation, delivery, and travel in the case of on-site events. If your organization has internal funding for external/guest lecturers and workshops, then I can simply issue a bill for the service (through my PLC consultancy, Datafigure OÜ). If you are an educational institution, then this could be potentially funded through a joint application to Erasmus+. Past workshops have also been funded by combinations of similar programmes and university travel grants. Feel free to get in touch to discuss options."
